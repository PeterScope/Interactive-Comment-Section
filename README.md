# Frontend Mentor - Interactive comments section

![Design preview for the Interactive comments section coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.


**This challenge required a strong understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The  challenge was to build out this interactive comments section and get it looking as close to the design [img] as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

### Expected behaviour

- First-level comments should be ordered by their score, whereas nested replies are ordered by time added.
- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- A confirmation modal should pop up before a comment or reply is deleted.
- Adding a new comment or reply uses the `currentUser` object from within the `data.json` file.
- You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.


**I had so much fun building!** ðŸš€
